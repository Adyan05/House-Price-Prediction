# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is focused on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the price of a house based on various features like size, location, number of rooms, etc. This project can be a useful tool for real estate businesses and individuals looking to estimate property values.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of key features and their relationships with the target variable.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features and selection of the most relevant ones.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model parameters to enhance performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparison of models using metrics like RMSE, R^2, and cross-validation scores.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
